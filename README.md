How do I approach designing software?
    My approach to designing software starts with identifying system goals and user needs. I break these down into modular components that can be designed, tested and refined     independantly. 
  
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    One thing I think I improved on for this project was my use of structured class heiraarchies and managing a data flow for rendering, input and scene management systems.
    
What design process did you follow for your project work?
    I used an iterative design process. I planned, prototyped, and tested my code. I then refined my features before the full integration.
    
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    By building modular code with an iterative tactic this streamlines debugging and makes collaboration easier to allow future projects to scale more efficiently.
    
How do I approach developing programs?
    I approach development by breaking down large goals into smaller achievable goals. This includes building code incrementally to maintain stability and testability.
    
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    I used reusable shader functions, camera control classes, and texture loading libraries to keep everything modular and maintainable.
    
How did iteration factor into your development?
    Using iteration allowed me to test and adjust my object placement, lighting, and visual effects until it met expectations.
    
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    I learned more about writing clean code, reusing code, and to rely on abstraction.
    
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    Computer science can help me in reaching by goals by giving me the problem solving skills and automation skills that can optimize technical and business flows.
    
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    Computer science can help me reach my goals by strengthing my knowledge of math and programming concepts that I can later apply in advanced graphic courses.
    
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
   computational graphics and visualizations enhances my ability to create interactive and visually engaging applications. These skills are valuable in game development, simulations and UI designs.
